# SportRadar Scoreboard POC

This project is a POC which simulates the score card of soccer matches


#Limitations
--------------
Due to time constraints, I was not able to use Typescript, and hence strong type cast-checking is not implemented in most of the places of the codebase.
I can explain more on this topic on discussion of my solution.
